        Time complexity refers to the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to execute. An algorithm is considered efficient if it can perform its task in a reasonable amount of time, even for large input data. Time complexity analysis helps us understand how an algorithm's running time scales with input size, allowing us to choose the most efficient algorithm for a given problem.

        <b>Space Complexity</b> is a measure of the memory space an algorithm or program uses to solve a problem as a function of the input size. It is often denoted by Big O notation (O(n)), where 'n' represents the size of the input. Efficient algorithms aim to minimize their space complexity while achieving the desired outcome. Space complexity analysis is crucial in optimizing memory usage and ensuring efficient resource management.
